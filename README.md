# image-clustering

Clusters media (photos, videos, music) in a provided Dropbox folder:

* In an unsupervised setting, k-means uses CNN embeddings as representations and with topic modeling, labels the clustered folders intelligently.
* In the semi-supervised setting, new photos can be clustered to be added to existing folders, or be classified in their own clusters.
